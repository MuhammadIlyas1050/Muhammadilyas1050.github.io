# Urban Arterial LOS Upgrade

- Role: Design & analysis (student)
- Area: Transportation
- Tools: Civil 3D, Synchro
- Standards: HCM
- Date: 2024

## Context
Four-leg signalized intersection experiencing peak-hour delay; limited right-of-way and adjacent commercial access points.

## Technical approach
- Turning movement counts; calibrated Synchro model; evaluated phasing alternatives.
- Civil 3D concept for right-turn pocket and channelization; pedestrian refuge islands.
- Signal timing optimization within controller constraints.

## Results
- Peak LOS improved from D to B; average control delay reduced by ~28%.
- Queue spillback mitigated with optimized storage lengths; ROW impacts minimized.
- Conflict points reduced through channelization and pedestrian refuge design.

## Reflection
Next: micro-simulation for platooning effects and pedestrian compliance sensitivity.
