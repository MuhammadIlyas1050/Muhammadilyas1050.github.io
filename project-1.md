# Pedestrian Bridge — 25 m Span

- Role: Structural design lead (student)
- Area: Structures
- Tools: ETABS, AutoCAD
- Codes: ACI, AISC
- Date: 2025

## Context
Single-span steel pedestrian bridge across a drainage channel; constraints: 25 m clear span, 1:100 wind exposure, 5 kPa pedestrian live load, cost cap. Objectives: minimize steel weight while controlling vibration and deflection.

## Technical approach
- Global model in ETABS; gravity/wind load combinations; pedestrian-induced vibration check.
- Member sizing and connection detailing; temperature/shrinkage allowances; bearing choice.
- Drawings in AutoCAD with callouts and standardized notes.

## Results
- 14% reduction in steel tonnage via section optimization and bracing refinement.
- Mid-span deflection within serviceability limit; fundamental frequency above comfort threshold.
- Fabrication-ready connection details with standardized bolt patterns.

## Reflection
Iterated bracing improved torsional stiffness; next: refine connection eccentricities and review fatigue for long-term service.
